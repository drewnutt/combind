# CMD = '$SCHRODINGER/shape_screen -shape {poses1} -screen {poses2} {typing} {norm} -distinct -inplace -NOJOBID'

# This shape screening is based on the Schrodinger paper: https://doi.org/10.1021/ci2002704
# Used a method which is quite similar to tanimoto similarity of the shapes but easier to calculate
# Different atom/feature types of the overlaps:
# Name    | Description
# -----   |-------
# None    |   all atoms equivalent (shape-only scoring)
# QSAR    |   Phase QSAR atom types 
# Element |   elemental atom types
# MMod	|   MacroModel atom types (over 150 unique atom types)
# Pharm	|   Phase pharmacophore feature types

# QSAR atom types = hydrophobic, electron withdrawing, H-bond donor, negative ionic, positive ionic, and other

# Pharmacophore feature types= aromatic, hydrophobic, H-bond acceptor, H-bond donor, negative ionic, and positive ionic.
# Each site was represented by a hard sphere of radius 2 Çº, and as with the atom typing schemes, volume overlap scores were only computed between sites of the same type
